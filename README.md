## ü§î FAQs

### ‚ùì How Can I Scrape All Reviews for Each Place?

By default, the scraper collects 20 Reviews per Place. To scrape all reviews without any limit, set `reviews_max` to `Gmaps.ALL_REVIEWS`. 

```python
queries = [
   "web developers in bangalore"
]

Gmaps.places(queries, scrape_reviews=True, max=5, reviews_max=Gmaps.ALL_REVIEWS)
```

Please note that some places may have thousands of reviews, so scraping all of them can be time-consuming. It's best to limit the number of reviews to a manageable number like 100 or 1000.

### ‚ùì How Can I Scrape Reviews for All Google Maps Places?

To scrape reviews from all Google Maps listings, open `main.py` and remove the `max` parameter. This allows you to scrape all listings for a given search. For example:

```python
queries = ["web developers in bangalore"]
Gmaps.places(queries, scrape_reviews=True)
```

Note that you can scrape a maximum of 120 leads per search, as Google does not display more search results beyond that. However, with thousands of cities worldwide, you won't run out of leads.

### ‚ùì How to Scrape Reviews for a Specific Search Query?

Update the `queries` list with your desired query. For example:

```python
queries = ["web developers in Delhi"]
Gmaps.places(queries, scrape_reviews=True, max=5)
```

### ‚ùì How to Scrape Reviews for Multiple Queries?

Add multiple queries to the `queries` list as shown below:

```python
queries = [
   "web developers in bangalore",
   "web developers in Delhi",
]
Gmaps.places(queries, scrape_reviews=True, max=5)
```

### ‚ùì How to Sort Reviews?

Use the `reviews_sort` parameter to sort reviews by criteria like Most Relevant, Newest, Highest Rating, or Lowest Rating

. Here's an example:

```python
queries = [
   "web developers in bangalore"
]

Gmaps.places(queries, scrape_reviews=True, max=5, reviews_max=100, reviews_sort=Gmaps.LOWEST_RATING)
```

### ‚ùì How Can I Filter Google Map Places from Which Reviews are Scraped?

You can apply filters such as:

1. `min_reviews`/`max_reviews` (e.g., 10)
2. `category_in` (e.g., "Dental Clinic", "Dental Laboratory")
3. `has_website` (e.g., True/False)
4. `has_phone` (e.g., True/False)
5. `min_rating`/`max_rating` (e.g., 3.5)

For instance, to scrape reviews for listings with at least 5 reviews and no more than 100 reviews, with a phone number but no website:

```python
Gmaps.places(queries, scrape_reviews=True, min_reviews=5, max_reviews=100, has_phone=True, has_website=False)
```

To scrape reviews for specific categories:

```python
Gmaps.places(queries, scrape_reviews=True, category_in=[Gmaps.Category.DentalClinic, Gmaps.Category.DentalLaboratory])
```

See the full list of supported categories [here](https://github.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-reviews-scraper/blob/master/categories.md).

### ‚ùì How to Scrape Reviews from All Cities in My Country?

To scrape reviews for top 5 web developers across 100 cities in India, for example, use the following:

```python
queries = Gmaps.Cities.India("web developers in")[0:100]
Gmaps.places(queries , scrape_reviews=True, max=5, reviews_max=100) 
```

After running the code, an `india-cities.json` file will be generated in the `output` directory with a list of all the Indian cities.

You can prioritize certain cities by editing the cities JSON file in the output folder and moving them to the top of the list.

We recommend scraping only 100 cities at a time, as countries like India have thousands of cities, and scraping them all could take a considerable amount of time. Once you've exhausted the outreach in 100 cities, you can scrape more.

See the list of all supported countries [here](https://github.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-reviews-scraper/blob/master/countries.md)

### ‚ùì Can I Interrupt the Scrape While It's Running?

Yes, you can interrupt the scraper, and it will resume from where it left off.

### ‚ùì What are Popular Snippets for Data Scientists?

- Scrape 100 Newest Google Maps Places Reviews of a Country and Store the Results as JSON.

```python
from botasaurus import bt

queries = Gmaps.Cities.India("your_target in")

scraped_places = Gmaps.places(queries, scrape_reviews=True, reviews_max=100)
bt.write_json(result, "scraped_places.json")
```

- Read the Data for Panda Analysis

```python
from botasaurus import bt

scraped_places = bt.read_json("scraped_places.json")
# Do whatever you want with scraped_places
```
